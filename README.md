## About Me

### Programming languages
- **PHP**: I mainly worked with projects related to [PocketMine-MP](https://pmmp.io) during secondary school.
  Since PHP was [unfortunately selected](https://doc.pmmp.io/en/rtfd/faq/about/why-php.html)
  as the language for PocketMine-MP, the related projects used PHP as well.
- **Rust**: Most of my personal projects are in Rust since 2019.
  I also engage on the rust language community discord regularly.
- **Go**: I have been working on Kubernetes-related projects in ByteDance,
  where Go is the first class language (also quite unfortunately).

### Scripting languages
- **jq**: I use jq for all scripting only involving deterministic computation.
- **Python**: I use Python as my calculator app and makeshift plotting tool.

### Development environment
- **Linux**: i :clap: use :clap: arch :clap: btw :clap: (with GNOME).
- **Bash**: My login shell is Bash.
- **Neovim**: My setup is [here](https://github.com/SOF3/nvim-config).
- And I ssh over tmux over mosh over iTerm2 when I am stuck with a MacBook.
- **Git**: I always prefer merge commits over rebasing.
  Force-pushing branches that have been checked out by other people is a crime.

### Statistics
~~Just some stickers like everyone else does because why not~~

## Personal blog
I have started jotting down some of my weird opinions
in the [wiki](https://github.com/SOF3/SOF3/wiki) of this personal repo.

## Highlighted projects
- I have started a lot of open-source projects for personal interest,
  but many are incomplete because of lack of time and financial support.
  Incomplete projects are marked as :hourglass_flowing_sand:.
- Each section is sorted in descending order of my personal affection for the projects.
  Projects beyond a certain threshold of personal affection are not listed here.
- Only projects where I am/was a maintainer are listed here.
  [Search on GitHub](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ASOF3)
  for a full list of my external contributions.

### General-purpose libraries

#### PHP
- [await-generator](https://github.com/SOF3/await-generator), a PHP library that enables async/await pattern.
- [thisrc](https://github.com/SOF3/php-ext-thisrc), a PHP extension that observes the refcount of the `$this` object without inducing side effects

#### Rust
- [portrait](https://github.com/SOF3/portrait), a Rust proc-macro framework to write trait-aware proc-macro attributes such as impl-by-delegation.
- [wordvec](https://github.com/SOF3/wordvec), a Rust library providing a thin and small vector with only 1/3 memory footprint of smallvec and comparable performance.
- [include-flate](https://github.com/SOF3/include-flate), a Rust macro for attaching constants as deflated strings in the executable.
- [dirmod](https://github.com/SOF3/dirmod), a Rust macro to smartly detect modules to include.
- [phar.rs](https://github.com/SOF3/phar.rs), a Rust library for the PHAR (PHp ARchive) format. Also includes a WASM app and a CLI command for phar manipulation.
- [xylem](https://github.com/SOF3/xylem), a Rust framework for statetul type conversion (a post-deserialize processing stage).

I have also created numerous tiny libraries in Rust,
but those generally have very ad-hoc purposes
and are not known to have any real users other than myself.
Check [crates.io](https://crates.io/users/SOF3?sort=recent-downloads) for a full list of my crayon crates.

#### JavaScript
- [rwlock-promise](https://github.com/SOF3/rwlock-promise), a JavaScript library that implements mutually-exclusive and shared-exclusive locks with a Promise API

### Programming language analysis
- [enclavlow](https://github.com/SOF3/enclavlow), my final year project that performs Java flow analysis to verify SGX data security.

### Cloud
These projects (and only these projects) are related to my work at ByteDance.

- [Kelemetry](https://github.com/kubewharf/kelemetry), an observability tool to provide global control plane tracing for Kubernetes.
- [Podseidon](https://github.com/kubewharf/podseidon), a Kubernetes webhook to protect pod deletion in multi-cluster microservices.
- [KubeAdmiral](https://github.com/kubewharf/kubeadmiral), a multi-cluster orchestrator and scheduler for Kubernetes.
- [KubeZoo](https://github.com/kubewharf/kubezoo), a lightweight multi-tenancy solution for Kubernetes.

### Game development
- [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP), a reverse-engineered Minecraft server software.
  - PocketMine-MP has a huge ecosystem of plugins, and most of my work in earlier years were related to developing tools and cohesion of the ecosystem,
    such as dependency management, build tools and common-dependency APIs.
  - PocketMine-MP is an ancient project started in 2012. Some of my contributions include introducing modern tools and paradigms to the project.
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: [dynec](https://github.com/SOF3/dynec), an ECS library that focuses on type safety and optimized for specific scenarios.
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: [Traffloat](https://github.com/traffloat/traffloat), a logistics simulation game written in Rust.
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: [omniatc](https://github.com/SOF3/omniatc), an open-source air traffic control simulator game in Rust.

### Robotics
I was a member of the [HKU Robocon Team](https://github.com/m2robocon).

### Android development
I developed these small apps for personal use over the years.

- [AndTransfer](https://github.com/SOF3/AndTransfer), a simple Android app that shares files to any [transfer.sh](https://transfer.sh) server.
- [Mentamatics](https://github.com/SOF3/Mentamatics), an app for practising mental arithmetic calculation.
- [MySQLClientCompact](https://github.com/SOF3/MySQLClientCompact), a small MySQL browser.

### Discord bots

- [bthint](https://github.com/SOF3/bthint), to tell people to \`\`\` their code blocks when asking for help.
- [orbs.bot](https://github.com/SOF3/orbs.bot), a fan project that reverse engineers the API of the webgame orbs.it and mirrors live games

## More noise that nobody cares
More about myself:
- I started coding in 2013, previously known as [@PEMapModder](https://github.com/PEMapModder),
  but I stopped using that account in an unsuccessful attempt
  to detox from my programming addiction in 2016 (which ended up to be a Hydra).
- I studied stuff related to computer science, statistics and mathematics in the University of Hong Kong,
  but I never got good grades in mathematics and never even liked statistics, so just forget it.
- I have been working in ByteDance since 2021 on Kubernetes and scheduling.

Interests:
- Please nerd snipe me with content related to aviation and classical music.
- I don't like working on problems without a deterministic solution.
  Thus, none of my projects are related to statistical learning, AI or LLMs.
- I never monetize my personal projects.
  I never work on anything directly related to e-commerce, advertisement.
  I will never work on anything directly related financial investment and trading.
