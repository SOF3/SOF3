Undergraduate Computing &amp; Data Analytics major in the University of Hong Kong.

### My Interests
- My primary language is Rust.
- My primary scripting languages are Bash, PHP, NodeJS and Python (in order of preference).
- My primary JVM language is Kotlin.
- My primary OS is Ubuntu (Alpine Linux for containers).
- I deploy everything with Docker.
- Most documents I produce are written in LaTeX or Markdown + Graphviz.
- My primary IDE is Vim. (Yes, it is an IDE provided sufficient configuration)
	- Nevertheless, I *do* write IntelliJ plugins.
- I like reviewing API and language designs.
	- I develop and contribute a number of general-purpose libraries.

*"Primary" means "default choice" here, not "only choice"*

### Highlighted projects
I have started a lot of open-source projects for personal interest,
but many are incomplete because of lack of time and financial support.
Incomplete projects are marked as :hourglass_flowing_sand:.

Some of these projects were not created or maintained by me,
but I included them here as I believe I have contributed a substantial amount of code to them.

#### Programming languages
- [await-generator](https://github.com/SOF3/await-generator), a PHP library that enables async/await pattern
- [dirmod](https://github.com/SOF3/dirmod), a Rust macro to smartly detect modules to include
- [rwlock-promise](https://github.com/SOF#/rwlock-promise), a JavaScript library that implements mutually-exclusive and shared-exclusive locks with a Promise API
- [thisrc](https://github.com/SOF3/php-ext-thisrc), a PHP extension that observes the refcount of the `$this` object without inducing side effects
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: [libglocal-idea-plugin](libglocal-idea-plugin), an intellij plugin for editing [libglocal](https://github.com/SOF3/libglocal) language files

I have also created numerous tiny macros and libraries in Rust,
but those generally have very ad-hoc purposes
and are not known to have any other users.
Examples include [serde-iter](https://github.com/SOF3/serde-iter),
[count-write](https://github.com/SOF3/count-write),
[qualify-derive](https://github.com/SOF3/qualify-derive), etc.

#### Game development
My programming career started from reverse engineering the game "Minecraft: Bedrock Edition".
As a result, more than half of my repositories and contributions were related to the
third-party server software [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP),
including its various modules and external plugin ecosystem.
Most of my recent PHP projects are related to modernizing PocketMine-MP
by adopting design approaches
(such as dependency injection, asynchronous programming, MVC, etc.)
from other programming languages and ecosystems.

#### Operating systems
- [gping](https://github.com/orf/gping), a command-line visualization of the `ping` command
- [include-flate](https://github.com/SOF3/include-flate), a Rust macro for attaching constants as deflated strings in the executable.
- [phar.rs](https://github.com/SOF3/phar.rs), a Rust library for the PHAR (PHp ARchive) format. Also includes a WASM app and a CLI command for phar manipulation.
- [enclavlow](https://github.com/SOF3/enclavlow), my final year project that performs Java flow analysis to verify SGX data security.
- [signed-vimrc](https://github.com/SOF3/signed-vimrc), a vim plugin that loads PGP-signed .vimrc files in cwd
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: [pathetique](https://github.com/SOF3/pathetique), an object-oriented abstraction of OS paths in PHP

#### Robotics
I am a member of the [HKU Robocon Team](https://github.com/m2robocon).

#### Web development
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: [octorest](https://github.com/SOF3/octorest), generated Rust bindings for the GitHub API (can adapt to other OpenAPI implementations too)
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: [webcord](https://github.com/SOF3/webcord), a webapp + discord bot that mirrors a discord chat

#### Android development
- [AndTransfer](https://github.com/SOF3/AndTransfer), a simple Android app that shares files to any [transfer.sh](https://transfer.sh) server.
- [Mentamatics](https://github.com/SOF3/Mentamatics), an app to train mental arithmetic calculation
- [MySQLClientCompact](https://github.com/SOF3/MySQLClientCompact), a small MySQL browser.

#### Discord bots
The Discord bots I write follow minimalistic approach
and rarely have sophisticated framework.

- [bthint](https://github.com/SOF3/bthint), a bot that tries to extract syntactically correct code from chat messages
- [boredphoton](https://github.com/pmmp/boredphoton), a minimalistic bot for alerting spam raids
- [orbs.bot](https://github.com/SOF3/orbs.bot), a fan project that reverse engineers the API of the webgame orbs.it and mirrors live games
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: [webcord](https://github.com/SOF3/webcord), a webapp + discord bot that mirrors a discord chat
